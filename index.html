        <div class="activityExcerpt">
            <p>The first and most important element of discipline is the decision to commit to your goals, to make sacrifices today that will pay off tomorrow. It isn't easy--if it were, everyone would do it--but it does work. If there's a secret to success, it's not in what people do--the actual act isn't a secret--but that they do it at all.</p>

        <div class="activityInterpretation">
            <p>Selecting a small set of goals that you have passion for will not guarantee that you will be disciplined to continue working towards them, but it certainly will help.</p>
